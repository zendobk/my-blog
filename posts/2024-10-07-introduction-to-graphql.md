---

This post introduces GraphQL, a query language for your API, and explains how it can be used as an alternative to REST for fetching data. GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. In this post, we will cover the basics of GraphQL, including its syntax, schema, and resolvers. We will also discuss the benefits of using GraphQL, such as improved performance and flexibility. By the end of this post, you will have a solid understanding of GraphQL and how it can be used to build efficient and flexible APIs.
